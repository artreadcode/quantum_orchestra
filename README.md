## The Project
Problem Statement: How can we map quantum states and operations to create music notes with different instruments?
Goal: Receive a quantum circuit and return an audio file, potentially a sheet paper.
Preliminary Solution: An interactive user friendly Jupyter notebook where a user can build a quantum circuit and receive both audio output and corresponding sheet music representing values of each qubit throughout the process.
